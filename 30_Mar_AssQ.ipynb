    ">Elastic Net Regression is a regression technique that combines the penalties of both Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression in order to overcome their limitations. Elastic Net Regression introduces a new tuning parameter, denoted as alpha (Î±), which controls the balance between the L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Like Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression, Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of Elastic Net Regression is to select a subset of the independent variables that are most important for predicting the dependent variable while also reducing the impact of multicollinearity and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Elastic Net Regression differs from other regression techniques in that it uses a combination of L1 and L2 penalties to achieve variable selection and regularization. The L1 penalty (also known as the Lasso penalty) shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively eliminating some variables from the model, while the L2 penalty (also known as the Ridge penalty) shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but not exactly to zero, and helps to reduce the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    ">By combining the penalties of both Lasso and Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression can overcome some of the limitations of each technique. Specifically, the L1 penalty in Elastic Net Regression can help to identify the most important variables for prediction and eliminate some variables, while the L2 penalty can help to reduce the impact of multicollinearity and stabilize the model.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The optimal value of the alpha parameter in Elastic Net Regression determines the balance between the L1 and L2 penalties. If alpha is set to 0, Elastic Net Regression reduces to Ridge Regression, while if alpha is set to 1, Elastic Net Regression reduces to Lasso Regression. Choosing the optimal value of alpha is important for achieving the best performance of the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Define a grid of values for alpha and lambda. Typically, we would choose a range of values for alpha between 0 and 1, and a range of values for lambda that includes very small values (close to zero) and very large values.\n",
